# ðŸŽ° Gambling Blocklist

> A curated and regularly updated list of gambling-related domains, designed for DNS-level blocking, firewalls, and content filtering systems.



## ðŸš« What is this?

This project maintains a comprehensive list of domains related to various forms of online gambling, including:

- **Online casinos** â€“ Platforms offering games like slots, poker, blackjack, and roulette  
- **Sports betting** â€“ Websites for placing bets on sports events  
- **Horse racing** â€“ Specialized sites for betting on horse and greyhound races

The primary goal is to **protect users** (especially minors and vulnerable individuals) and **empower system administrators** to block or filter harmful and addictive online content.
